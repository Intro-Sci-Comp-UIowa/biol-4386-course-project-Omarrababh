#### Attached is the excel sheet I will reporduce

The  excel sheet  " ALLgen_sampples ..etc" was created from a senior in my lab; the source of data is samples i collected from cardiomycytes as source of RNA. 

It contain gene expression for each samples ( total 5, 3 are smples and two are control) ,its power, significant and its value compare to control.

The first set of groups (from cell D:O merge all control together and the target region of intercalated discs together. the other set contain data for each sample.
The column "b" refer to fold changes between control and samples.
for RNA anlaysis; The gene that has N/A was omitted from data used for volcano plot

The other excel sheet named "genego" this one more organized I used for making the GO ontology enrichment analysis. The Rmarkdown and images is uploaded in analysis section. 

These data are result of RNA anlaysis of sequenced RNA comparing between intercalted discs and control. The RNA sequence as done by IOWA Genomic core; the results uploaded as FASTAQ files, initial analysis and making these excel sheets which I used a s source of my images was done by senior researcher in our lab.
